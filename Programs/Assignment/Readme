Our program simulates an airline booking system. It performs the following functions:
 * Check if a user exists in the database.
 * Handle rebooking of a flight.
 * Register a new user.
 * Authenticate discount coupons.
We have designed this robust program that can handle a wide range of user inputs seamlessly.
